friendica is installed. You are almost done!
You will need to:

0. possibly setup a vhost file.

1. setup a mysql database:
mysql> CREATE DATABASE friendica DEFAULT CHARACTER SET 'UTF8';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON friendica.* TO 'friendica'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'safe_password_here';

2. Use http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR} (use https when using ssl) to finish the setup.

Use the official install howto as reference: https://github.com/friendica/friendica/blob/master/INSTALL.txt

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING:
Run (replace host, dir and newversion as needed):
webapp-config --upgrade --host=vhost --dir=/friendica friendica newversion
CONFIG_PROTECT="/var/www/${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/htdocs/$VHOST_APPDIR/" dispatch-conf
Make sure to follow additional official upgrade instructions (updating database).
