tine20 is installed. You are almost done!
You will need to:

0. possibly setup a vhost file.

1. configure it by creating/editing the config file:
${MY_INSTALLDIR}/tine20/config.inc.php (you can skip the database and only setup the "setupuser")

2. setup a mysql database:
mysql> CREATE DATABASE tine20 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET 'UTF8';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tine20.* TO 'tine20'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'safe_password_here';

3. Use http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/setup.php to finish the setup (login with the username and password specified in the config.inc.php file).
