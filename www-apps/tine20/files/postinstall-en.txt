tine20 is installed. You are almost done!
You will need to:

0. possibly setup a vhost file.

1. configure it by creating/editing the config file:
${MY_INSTALLDIR}/tine20/config.inc.php (you can skip the database and only setup the "setupuser")

2. setup a mysql database:
mysql> CREATE DATABASE tine20 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET 'UTF8';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tine20.* TO 'tine20'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'safe_password_here';

3. Install dependencies with composer
cd ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/tine20
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install

4. Use http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/setup.php to finish the setup (login with the username and password specified in the config.inc.php file).

Use the official install howto as reference: https://www.tine20.org/wiki/index.php/Admins/Install_Howto

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING:
Run (replace host, dir and newversion as needed):
webapp-config --upgrade --host=vhost --dir=/tine20 tine20 newversion
CONFIG_PROTECT="/var/www/tine20.domain.org/htdocs//" dispatch-conf
Run step 3 from above & make sure to follow additional official upgrade instructions (updating database).
